# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tomi Nikolov

## ðŸ’» Full stack Web Developer

I am a strongly motivated and disciplined JavaScript Web Developer who is always eager to learn and improve. Being goal-oriented, proactive, and detail-oriented are integral parts of my character. When it comes to writing code, thinking, and learning, I give 100% of myself and feel truly alive.

Currently, I am continuing my growth journey by learning about DevOps at SoftUni. I am excited about the opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills in this field.
